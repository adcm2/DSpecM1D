# Implementation Status

## 2026-07-15 — GitHub Actions dependency checkout fix

- Removed shallow cloning from commit-pinned `FetchContent` dependencies in the
  project build and installed package configuration.
- Retained shallow cloning for Eigen because it is pinned by the `3.4.0` tag.
- Reason: a shallow clone of GSHTrans could no longer check out the older pinned
  commit after its default branch advanced, causing `build-test-smoke` to fail
  during CMake configuration.
- Verification completed from a clean `/tmp/dspecm1d-ci-fix` build tree:
  - CI-equivalent CMake configuration passed with freshly cloned dependencies.
  - Full build passed.
  - All 46 unit/component tests passed.
  - All 3 smoke tests passed.
  - The `website` documentation target passed.
